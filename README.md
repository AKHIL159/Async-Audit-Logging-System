# ⚡ Async Audit Logging System

A scalable asynchronous backend system built with **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **PostgreSQL**, designed to demonstrate concurrent request processing, decoupled audit logging, and enterprise-grade backend architecture.

This project focuses on:
- Asynchronous execution
- Concurrent backend processing
- REST API design
- Thread pool management
- Dual-database architecture
- Observability & audit systems

---

# 🚀 Overview

The system provides REST APIs for managing user operations while asynchronously recording detailed audit logs without blocking the primary request lifecycle.

User data is stored in **MongoDB**, while audit events are persisted separately in **PostgreSQL** to simulate enterprise-scale observability and compliance systems.

The application leverages:
- `CompletableFuture`
- Spring Async Processing
- Custom Thread Pools
- Concurrent execution patterns

to improve responsiveness and system scalability.

# 🧠 Core Engineering Concepts

## Asynchronous Backend Design
Implemented asynchronous workflows using:
- `@EnableAsync`
- `@Async`
- `CompletableFuture`

to separate business operations from audit persistence.

---

## Thread Pool Management

Configured custom thread pools using:

```java
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor
```

with:
- core pool sizing
- max thread scaling
- queue management

for controlled concurrency handling.

---

## Observability & Audit Systems

Designed a lightweight audit infrastructure that records:
- execution metadata
- request context
- thread information
- operation outcomes

without impacting API response latency.

---

## Polyglot Persistence

Implemented a dual-database strategy:
- MongoDB for operational user data
- PostgreSQL for structured audit records

to separate transactional and analytical concerns.

# 📊 Audit Logging Workflow

```text
Incoming API Request
        │
        ▼
Business Logic Execution
        │
        ▼
Immediate API Response
        │
        ▼
Separate Async Thread
        │
        ▼
Persist Audit Metadata
```

This architecture prevents logging operations from blocking user-facing API execution.

---

# 🧵 Threading Model

The application demonstrates:
- request thread separation
- async worker thread execution
- concurrent task delegation
- scalable background processing

Audit operations run independently from primary business workflows.

---

# 🔐 Engineering Challenges Solved

- Decoupling audit logging from request lifecycle
- Managing concurrent execution safely
- Designing scalable async workflows
- Maintaining thread-aware observability
- Integrating multiple persistence technologies

---

# 📈 Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed to support:
- higher request throughput
- independent audit scaling
- asynchronous side-effect handling
- reduced request blocking

Future enhancements may include:
- Kafka event streaming
- distributed tracing
- reactive programming
- centralized logging systems
